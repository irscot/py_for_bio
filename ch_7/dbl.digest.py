In the chapter_7 file inside the exercises download, 
there's a file called dna.txt which contains a made-up DNA sequence. 

Predict the fragment lengths that we will
get if we digest the sequence with two made-up 
restriction enzymes â€“ AbcI, whose
recognition site is ANT*AAT, and AbcII, whose recognition site 
is GCRW*TG (asterisks indicate the position of the cut site)
